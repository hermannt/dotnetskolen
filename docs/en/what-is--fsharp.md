# What is F#?

F# is a functional programming language for .NET, and is widely used in NRK TV and NRK Radio since the language's type system is well suited for modeling in [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). When you install the [.NET SDK](what-is-dotnet.md) a compiler for F# is included, and you can thus develop and run F# code. As mentioned in the introduction, all coding in this course will be done in F#.
